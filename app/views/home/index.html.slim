          markdown:
            I've been programming for a large part of my life. Since I was about
            10 or 11 years old in fact (I'm currently #{@age} years old).
            It started with animated PowerPoint slides,
            progressing into batch scripts on Windows, then some adventures in C++
            before I landed in C# and Lua as my main languages.

            I don't remember how I ended up with C#, but since my platform at the
            time was Windows and I had started using Visual Studio for my C++ code,
            C# was close at hand. The reason for learning Lua was much simpler:
            World of Warcraft. Since the game uses Lua for its AddOn API, I started
            learning it when I wanted to add functionality to the game.

            My very first (at least first *real*) AddOn for WoW was [Chocobo][].
            A friend wanted chocobo music from Final Fantasy to play when they used
            certain mounts in the game reminiscent of the chocobos, so I made it
            reality!

            On the C# side, I was doing mostly utility things and homework-style
            projects from the book "Head First C#". Some of the projects can be
            found on my [GitHub profile][github], but others have sadly been lost,
            as I did not utilize any version control software in the very
            beginnings.

            I continued to maintain my programming interest throughout my early
            life and into higher education. Beginning with an engineering
            programme at high school and then pursuing a computer science
            degree at university.

            ### Present day

            Today I work professionally as a programmer, living the dream as it were.
            Currently doing C# work
            at [Ninetech][] as a Systems Developer. A job I managed to secure
            straight out of university, in large thanks to the mentoring
            programme at Karlstad University.

            I also maintain a bunch of hobby projects on my free time, including
            this personal website. Other notable hobby projects include&hellip;

            #### [Colore][]

            > A powerful and elegant C# library for Razer Chroma's SDK.

            Essentially a wrapper around Razer's own C++ SDK for their Chroma
            APIs. Designed to be familiar and friendly to C# developers, taking
            care of all nasty native code shenanigans and presenting an API
            designed for use in the .NET ecosystem.

            #### [cshrix][] & [cshrix-bot][]

            Work-in-progress [library][cshrix] and [bot][cshrix-bot] for the
            [Matrix protocol][matrix]. Made with C# targeting .NET Standard.

            Sort of a successor to my earlier projects [chatrix][] and
            [chatrix-bot][].

            #### [klox][]

            A Kotlin implementation of the Lox programming language. This project
            was made following the excellent book ["Crafting Interpreters"][ci]
            by Bob Nystrom.

            #### [Advent of Code solutions][aoc-repo]

            I maintain a [repository on GitHub][aoc-repo] for my solutions to the
            [Advent of Code][aoc] annual event. I do them in a variety of
            languages, but mainly scripting/dynamic languages as they tend to be
            quicker to write solutions in.

    This site is made with [Ruby on Rails][ror], running [Puma][] as application server and [nginx][] for web server
    (acting as a reverse proxy). [Bulma][] and [Font Awesome][fa] were used to design it. The whole thing runs on a VPS
    provided by [DigitalOcean][do] (if you're browsing the staging site, it's hosted by [Heroku][]).

    You can find the source code for this site at [GitHub][]!

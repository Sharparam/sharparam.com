markdown:
  This site is made with Ruby on Rails, running Puma as application server and nginx for web server
  (acting as a reverse proxy). Bulma was used to design it. The whole thing runs on a VPS provided by DigitalOcean
  (if you're browsing the staging site, it's hosted by Heroku).

  You can find the source code for this site at [GitHub][]!

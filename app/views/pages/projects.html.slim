         | During my years as a hobbyist programmer and web developer, I've created quite a few projects that may or may
           not be worth sharing. I'll try to list the ones I find most interesting here on this page.

        h2 This site!
        p I suppose this list wouldn't really be complete without including itself in the project & sites list...
        p
         | One of the reasons I created this site was so that I could learn more about
         abbr<> title="Ruby on Rails" RoR
         | and get experience with it.
        p
         | Another reason was the fact that I needed somewhere to put my stuff. Showcase it if you will.
           As you probably have discovered already, I also put a blog on it. But I have a feeling it's not

         | During my years in "hÃ¶gstadiet" (7th-9th year of elementary school) one of my teachers, who happened to
           be a member of a local movie group, saw my interest in making web pages. He and I talked and agreed to
           let me construct a website for the group where there would be information about it and upcoming movies.
        p
         | The result is the site you see pictured above (which is also a link to the actual page). On it you can
           find info about membership costs and what movies are about to come.
